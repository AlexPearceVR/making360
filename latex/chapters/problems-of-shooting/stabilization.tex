\problem

{\large You are shooting a moving shot and need to have the smoothest stabilization. \par}

Most 360 video shots are static, with the rig placed in a position. Dolly and drone shots add exciting movement to the experience.

Any movement of the camera is magnified in the headset and can cause nausea if not shot properly.
