\problem

{\large You need to synchronize the cameras to each other. 

 \par}

If you have the time and materials, do a motion flash sync in addition to audio. The speed of light is faster than sound so a flash sync will be 900,000 times more accurate than audio sync. 
\solution

{\large DIY.

 \par}

MewPro is currently working on a genlock dongle that will allow true genlock syncing multiple GoPros. The dongle allows frame sync (VSYNC) as well as scan line sync (HSYNC) but are only available for the Hero 3+ Black currently.
