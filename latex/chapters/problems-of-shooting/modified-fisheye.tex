\problem

{\large You want to shoot with fisheye lens.  \par}


\solution

{\large Carefully remove and replace the lens .  
 \par}

With modified fisheye lens on the GoPros, you have greater coverage per camera with more overlap. Less cameras are needed in the rig for a full 360 stitch which means less seams and parallax! Subjects can get real close to a camera without breaking a seam. With more overlap, you can also shift the seams when rotoscoping or masking. However, since there is so much more coverage, a lot of the image is in the overlap, resulting in a lower final output resolution for the panorama. Shoot on the 2.7k settings to achieve 4k final output.
