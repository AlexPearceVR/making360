\problem

{\large Which brand and size of micro SD cards should you purchase? 
 \par}

Nike vs Adidas. FujiFilm vs Kodak. SanDisk vs Lexar. 


\solution

{\large Sell out and go with the name brand GoPro endorsed and recommended cards.

 \par}

Use the same make of cards for all the cameras. You want all the cameras as identical as possible so the micro SD cards matter as well. Get the cards with the fastest read/write speeds. The cards with fastest write speed will perform better in the cameras. Having fastest read speed will minimize file transfer time. Spend more money on the higher class cards since they will last longer as well. 

The SanDisk Extreme PLUS 64GB or Lexar 633x 64GB is recommended.
