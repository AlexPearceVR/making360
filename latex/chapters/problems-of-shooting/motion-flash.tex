\problem

{\large You need to synchronize the cameras to each other. 

 \par}

If you have the time and materials, do a motion flash sync in addition to audio. The speed of light is faster than sound so a flash sync will be 900,000 times more accurate than audio sync. 

\solution

{\large Use an umbrella and speedlight.

 \par}

Some people like to twist the camera rig for motion detection but this shakes the individual cameras in the custom rigs and is not accurate down to the exact frame. 

Use an umbrella over the rig and give it a flash. In post, you can find the exact moment where the white from the flash emerges, down to the exact frames. 

Here is a test with a speedlight at 60fps. 

IMAGE

Even at a high FPS, you can see that the cameras are still fractions out of sync from each other. This is a problem until there is true genlock/frame sync. Notice the GoPro rolling shutter effect.
