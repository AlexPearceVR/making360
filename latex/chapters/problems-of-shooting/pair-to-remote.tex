\problem

{\large The camera rig is out of reach and you can’t manually hit record.  \par}

In some situations, you won’t be able to manually trigger the cameras. For example, if the cameras are rigged high up, on a dolly or drone. You can use a WIFI or smart remote to easily turn all the cameras in a rig on and off!  


\solution

{\large Use a WIFI or Smart remote. 
 \par}

The remotes can trigger up to 50 gopros at once. Before the shoot, pair a remote to the rig. The WIFI will have to be turned on for each camera. This will drain the batteries faster so if you are in a situation where you can’t constantly charge batteries and backups, then make sure to save power by turning the WIFI off between takes. 

You will probably want to use this method even if the camera is in reach so the cameras will roll at approximately the same time. The cameras will still be a few frames off from each other.  If you are on set or have backup batteries then leaving WIFI on will not be an issue. If you are in the field and need to save all the power you can, stick to manually triggering the cameras.
