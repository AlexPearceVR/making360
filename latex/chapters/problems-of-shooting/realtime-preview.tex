\problem

{\large You can’t see what you are shooting.  \par}


Although happy accidents are sometimes welcome, in analog film they can result in beautiful emulsions.  Shooting blind is not the most ideal in VR and can result in horrendous unfixable seams, dropped cameras, changed camera settings, etc. 


\solution

{\large Create a realtime stitcher with TouchDesigner for live preview. 
 \par}

To create your own realtime preview, use TouchDesigner’s 360 Stitcher Component - https://www.derivative.ca/wiki088/index.php?title=Stitcher. A powerful graphics card and video capture card is required. The nvidia GTX 980 is recommended. 

The stitcher component will parse a PTGui Pro project file, create the amount of inputs needed and apply the warping. Similar to APG, take a snapshot of a frame from each of the cameras and create a calibration. Then instead of applying the calibration to render video frames, the warping and position will be performed on the video inputs in realtime. Save your .pts file and load it into the stitcher component. Connect an Oculus Rift component in TouchDesigner to output the live feed to a headset.

Congrats! Now you have an on set preview for the director.
