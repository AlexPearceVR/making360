\problem

{\large You are using a monopod but canâ€™t hold it without being in the shot. \par}

Unless you are taking the ultimate 360 selfie. 

\solution

{\large Use a sandbag.  
 \par}

If you are shooting on set and have a controlled environment and props, you can use a monopod. Use parallax to your advantage and fix the camera rig so the monopod falls between two cameras. 

IMAGE

For example, if you have the monopod diagonally set over a couch, then the sandbag will be hidden out of view. The monopod will fall into the parallax zone and not show up in the stitch.
