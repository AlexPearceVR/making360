\problem

{\large You charged the batteries last night but there’s only one bar left all of a sudden!
 \par}

Prepare extra provisions. GoPro batteries can drain very quickly so be sure to pack extra batteries. Over time they will also be able to hold less charge. 


\solution

{\large Charge and recharge. Cycle and recycle. 
 \par}

You can charge the batteries inside the camera through USB or with external battery chargers. It’s nice to have multiple dual battery chargers so you can speed up the process. Also, keeping a system in place to identify between drained or full batteries is helpful on set. Put gaffer’s tape on the ones with full charge to identify between the ones that need to be recharged. 

To lengthen the lifespan of your rechargeable batteries, use the batteries until they drain instead of constantly recharging them. Then they will be able to charge a full cycle and also last long with each turn.
