\problem

{\large You need to synchronize the cameras to each other. 

 \par}

There is no genlock sync on the cameras yet so videos will have to be synced manually in post. Give yourself or the stitcher as many ways possible to find a sync point. 

\solution

{\large Slate and clap.

 \par}

The old fashioned slate. and 3 loud claps. or any noise with a fast sharp attack will be easier to sync in post.
