\problem

{\large You shot a night scene and your GoPros are too noisy. \par}

Shooting with GoPros even using Protune will not replace the quality of lenses from DSLR, adjusting the ISO, Low Light and EV Comp options will not guarantee you better nightime shots. It will introduce noise. It will be too dark. It could be unstitchable and it could be distracting in a headset. For optimal conditions for shooting with GoPros, check the Lighting chapter.

\solutions

{\large Denoise with Neat Video. \par}

Install Neat Video plugin for AE or Premiere on PC or Mac. The home version will only denoise footage with 1920x1080 resolution, you will need to install the Pro version. 

Neat Video does a great job at denoising videos and applying Neat Video on your individual cameras before stitching will help find more control points and in some cases will even permit you to stitch. Below is an example of stitching 3 images by auto-detect the points and geometries right from APG. With Neat Video, some noisy footage can actually be a problem for APG.

Import your invidvidual cameras into AE and create multiple new compositions from files. Find "Reduce Noise" plugin in AE effects and apply it to each of your clip layers. Make sure AE preview is set to Full resolution and disable the Fast Preview for optimal performance. Click on "prepare" from the effect controls of Reduce Noise effect, and register your license of Neat if you haven't. You will auto-create a noise profile by selecting Auto Profile, then refine the area by moving the blue box in an area which contains most of the noise and without difference in colors. For example, placing or drawing a green box on the noisy sky or ground of your video.

The noise profile captured from the selected area will be applied to the whole frame and throughout the duration of your individual clips. Use the temporal filter to increase the number of frames before and after the selected frame. Neat will calculate better the amound of reduction for upcoming frames. Rarely use the spatial filter.

Render your videos separately as .mov files or as a tiff sequence you can later convert to mp4. 

After comparing noisy footage before and after using Neat Video in AVP, here are the results. AVP found more control points with default auto-detection and the noise have been great reduced.

\tip Neat Video may be fixing its software on recent versions of Adobe softwares, if you experienced problems, try AE CC 2014 instead of 2015.
