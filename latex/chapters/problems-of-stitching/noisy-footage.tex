\problem

{\large You shot a night scene and your GoPros are too noisy. \par}

Shooting with GoPros even using Protune will not replace the quality of lenses from DSLR, adjusting the ISO, Low Light and EV Comp options will not guarantee you better nightime shots. It will introduce noise. It will be too dark. It could be unstitchable and it could be distracting in a headset. For optimal conditions for shooting with GoPros, check the Lighting chapter.
