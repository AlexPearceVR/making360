\problem

{\large After coloring the blacks, you get more banding. After sharpening, a cable appears at 180 degree. \par}

Color grading 360x180 latlong is not like coloring any other flat videos. Adjustment layers cover all the pixels of your equirectangular panorama. How can you color grade, sharpen and blur as you normally would? Coloring the lows, mids and highs can introduce unwanted banding, how should you color grade?

\solution

{\large The ultimate sophistication. Da Vinci. \par}



{\large What's that cable? \par}
